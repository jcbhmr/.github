If you don't want to use the devcontainer, that's OK too! Just make sure that
your local environment has the dependencies specified in the
[`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`] file.

After starting up your dev env and cloning the project, you can run
`tools/dev.sh` to spin up the backend watcher, frontend watcher, and fetch
external assets from AWS. You can find more commands in [`.vscode/tasks.json`].
