Certain tools that GitHub offers seem to fit into certain "ideal usecases" in my
brain. ðŸ§  Here's a rundown of how I like to use the various GitHub tools:

- Use Discussions for discussing ideas, polls, or unrelated topics.
- Use Issues as a todo list. Discuss things related to solving the todo.
- Use PRs for documenting the _progress_ of a thing. Often related to Issues.
